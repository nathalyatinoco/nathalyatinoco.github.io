    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hi! My name is Nathalya, but everyone calls me <abbr title="Nathalya">Naty</abbr> or <i>"pechi".</i> For those who don't know Spanish, <em>"pechi"</em> is the sweetest way to say you are adorable. My pronouns are she/her.</p>
    <p>I was born in Colombia on May 25<sup>th</sup>, 1989. Since I was a little kid, I have considered myself an artsy person. I love to imagine and create pieces of art. Even though I have a law degree, I decided to follow my instincts. Therefore, I chose to believe in my dream to have my own business, and ten years ago, I was the CEO and founder of Luxury Cards. <a href="http://www.luxurycards.shop">Check it out!</a></p>
    <p>My first challenge was to materialize an invitation. I learned how to use design tools that were never between my codes and jurisprudence books in my law career. I officially started my first order with the wedding of a top model in my country, and then, the card had free publicity on an entertainment show that advertised it. Four years later, with a whole team, I opened my first store in a shopping center, and International fashion firms such as Dolce Gabbana and Louis Vuitton called me to work for their new launches in Colombia. Hotel chains and brides from Miami and Mexico became my potential clients.</p>

<p>I want to tell you that we must have faith and believe that it is okay to dream, take risks, be brave, and have attitude, discipline, and persistence. Let's take the opportunities, take advantage of innate talents, and set goals regardless of the pace.</p>
